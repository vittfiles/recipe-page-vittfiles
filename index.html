              <h2>Instructions</h2>
    
              <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>
                  <p>
                    adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat
                    oven to 350ºF (177ºC).
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Make the crust: Using a food processor, pulse the graham
                    crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar
                    and melted butter until combined. [You can also pulse it all
                    together in the food processor .] Misture will be sandy. Press
                    firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or
                    10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use
                    the bottom or a measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly.
                    Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and lace the hot
                    pan on a large piece of aluminium fail. The fail will wrap
                    around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to
                    slightly cool as you prepare the filling.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Make the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a
                    paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar
                    together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture
                    is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream,
                    vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined.
                    On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each
                    addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated
                    into he batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from
                    deflating and cracking as ir cools, avoid over-mixing the batter
                    as best you can.

                    Prepare the simple water bath (see note) Boil a por of water.
                    You need 1 inche of water in your roasting pan for the water
                    bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of
                    hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil
                    around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of
                    the crust. se a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an
                    even layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan.
                    Carefully pur the hot water inside of the pan and place in the
                    oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then
                    pur the hot water in. Whickever is easier for you.)
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost
                    set. When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly
                    wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open
                    the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in
                    the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven
                    and water bath, then cool cheesecake comopletely at room
                    temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at last 4 hours
                    or overnight.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the
                    springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife,
                    cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife
                    clean and dip into warm water between eack slice.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover
                    cheesecake in the refrigerator for up 5 days.
